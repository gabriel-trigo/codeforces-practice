    "Alice and Bob are playing a game. There is 𝑛×𝑛 grid, initially empty. We refer to the cell in row 𝑖 and column 𝑗 by (𝑖,𝑗) for 1≤𝑖,𝑗≤𝑛. There is an infinite supply of tokens that come in 3 colors labelled 1, 2, and 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "The game proceeds with turns as follows. Each turn begins with Alice naming one of the three colors, let's call it 𝑎. Then, Bob chooses a color 𝑏≠𝑎, chooses an empty cell, and places a token of color 𝑏 on that cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "We say that there is a conflict if there exist two adjacent cells containing tokens of the same color. Two cells are considered adjacent if they share a common edge.\n",
    "\n",
    "If at any moment there is a conflict, Alice wins. Otherwise, if 𝑛2 turns are completed (so that the grid becomes full) without any conflicts, Bob wins.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have a proof that Bob has a winning strategy. Play the game as Bob and win.\n",
    "\n",
    "The interactor is adaptive. That is, Alice's color choices can depend on Bob's previous moves.\n",

    "Interaction\n",
    "The interaction begins by reading a single integer 𝑛 (2≤𝑛≤100) — the size of the grid.\n",
    "\n",
    "The turns of the game follow. You should begin each turn by reading an integer 𝑎 (1≤𝑎≤3) — Alice's chosen color.\n",

    "Then you must print three integers 𝑏,𝑖,𝑗 (1≤𝑏≤3,𝑏≠𝑎,1≤𝑖,𝑗≤𝑛) — denoting that Bob puts a token of color 𝑏 in the cell (𝑖,𝑗). The cell (𝑖,𝑗) must not contain a token from a previous turn. If your move is invalid or loses the game, the interaction is terminated and you will receive a Wrong Answer verdict.\n",
    "\n",
    "After 𝑛2 turns have been completed, make sure to exit immediately to avoid getting unexpected verdicts.\n",
    "\n",
    "After printing something do not forget to output end of line and flush the output. Otherwise, you will get Idleness limit exceeded. To do this, use:\n",

    "The first line contains a single integer 𝑛 (2≤𝑛≤100).\n",
    "\n",
    "The second line contains 𝑛2 integers 𝑎1,…,𝑎𝑛2 (1≤𝑎𝑖≤3), where 𝑎𝑖 denotes Alice's color on the 𝑖-th turn.\n",

    "The interactor might deviate from the list of colors in your hack, but only if it forces Bob to lose."
